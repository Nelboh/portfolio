# Welcome to my portfolio

This is the third website I've built from scratch, and I've learned a ton in the process. You can [see it here](https://ellie.developme.space/index.html).

Here you'll find a little bit about me and my skills, as well as a few samples of work I've done in the past. 

## For the eagle-eyed

If you take a look in the assets folder, you'll find a sub-folder full of the various design ideas I came up with in the process of making my portfolio. 

In the end, I settled for something halfway between the first and last designs. I had to make a few changes along the way (the shape of the tabs, for instance), but on the whole I'm really pleased with how close it turned out to my mockup.

For those who are interested, I used Affinity Designer to put these together. I find mocking up designs in this way really helpful when it comes to actually building sites, as it helps me visualise how I'm going to achieve a particular effect -- for instance, the precise radius and blur of the drop shadows, or the folded edges of the sliders (which ended up being a gradient with hard stops).
